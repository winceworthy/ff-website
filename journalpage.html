        <b>01-02-25</b>  Today I made a webpage. Happy new year!
        <br><br>
        <b>01-03-25</b>  Today I made another webpage!
        <br><br>
        <b>01-05-2025</b>  Today I made the website live! Welcome to the Grand Opening of Femboy Fisticuffs dot com, or the Fistiblog. My reasons for creating this site are various and deeply personal. I want a place that is safe and free, and with the understanding that such a place must be cultivated meticulously rather than simply found, I'm in the process of forging that place. I hope so, anyway.
        <br><br>
        <b>01-12-25</b> Today the website becomes fully realized! I put a lot of work in getting the site in working order today. The biggest hurdle was formatting it for mobile, which took actual hours. 
        I also have a domain, too! femboyfisticuffs.com is real at last.
         Anyway, I just survived both a State of Emergency and a local infrustructure crisis.
          Apparently three inches of snow is enough to cripple a water treatment plant supplying hundreds of thousands. Regular Monday in Richmond. By the way, Ethan's a bitch.

        <b>05/06/2025</b> The thing I expected to do but didn't want to do ended up happening. As you may notice I've been away from the site for a while,
         and the only reason is because I basically lost interest and forgot about it for that entire time. I'd like to change that and utilize this site for all of its original purposes.
         Creativity and writing in general are things I've wanted to get back into for a long time now but have been stricken with an indescribable mental block. Effort is a weird concept when you're depressed 
         I have the time, and because I'm awake that means I must have the energy, but so often I'm simply barred from what I want to do with myself. I'm not, though, of course. Not really.
         I've come to understand that for all practical applications, there is no such thing as "motivation," so why don't I just sit down and write something? Well, here we are. I want to change that,
         and by my expression of wanting to do so in this etheric space that is the internet, perhaps I am. Anyway, there are plenty of updates with the happenings of my life. Z and I are moving in together
         in less than two months! We should probably start packing, like last week. I've been spending 99% of my time in their apartment so it's like we already live together. Right now my room
         is basically serving as storage... and lodging for someone running away from home at the ripe age of 21. Longer story than I care to write in VSCode... They're here for the week
         and after that is up to them to figure out. I want to hope for the best for them, truly, but I fear they are massively unprepared for what the real world has to offer. God knows I was. I had the support of my parents and still
         I went through hell. It hasn't been too bad of a time to be honest, but I'm definitely not taking in any more strays after this.
